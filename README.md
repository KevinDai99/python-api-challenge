In this project I analyzed the corelation between max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and windspeed with latitude. Moreover, I devided latitude up into seperate hemispheres - North/South - to get a complete picture of the relationship. 

1) the strongest relationship is between max temperature, and latitude, with the casuality explained the earth's spherical shape, and the amount of sunlight. However, this relationship was not strong ~0.5 r , as other factors collectively effect max temperature, such as proxmity to bodies of water, or mountain ranges. 

2) The other factors (humidity, cloudiness, and windspeed) had a weak or little correlationship with latidute. This is likey again, due to other factors playing more dominant roles, and remains for further investigation. 

I also explored my favourite places to vacation. Based on my humidity and max temperature fitlers, this limited to places near the equator, focusing on Africa, and south east Asia.
